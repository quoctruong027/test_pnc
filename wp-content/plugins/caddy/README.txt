== Installation ==

Important: You must download and activate the WooCommerce plugin, before using Caddy.

= Install Caddy from within WordPress =
1. Visit the plugins page within your dashboard and click the 'Add New' button.

3. Click the install button.
4. Click the activate button.
5. Find the 'Caddy' menu within your dashboard and change your plugin settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add or replace the 'Cart' and 'Saved' menu links? =

We recommend using the [Shortcodes in Menus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-in-menus/) plugin and then adding the following Caddy shortcodes:
\[cc_saved_items text="Saves" icon="yes"\]
\[cc_cart_items text="Cart" icon="yes"\]

The "text" value is the text that you want to appear in your menu.
The "icon" value (yes or no) will display a heart icon for the "Saves" link and a cart icon for the "Cart" link
