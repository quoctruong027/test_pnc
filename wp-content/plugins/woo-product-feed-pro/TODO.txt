So you found my to-do list for this plugin? Well, hope you enjoy the little sneak preview of what's coming. 
Missing some features you might like? Drop me a line at support@adtribes.io and we might just add it to the list. Thanks!

Tutorial / Blog posts:
- Explain all the different fields/attributes that can be selected from the drop-downs

Priority issues:
- Add a preview option so only 5-10 products are being generated
- Own hosted plugin updating: https://rudrastyh.com/wordpress/self-hosted-plugin-update.html
- Google local product feed inventory in XML format (not just TXT like it is now)
- Add support for Multisites
- Add a filter on review score (and amount of reviews)
- Make extra woosea fields available for front-end usage
- Only update feed when changes to products have been made
- Add header to extra fields on product edit pages
- Add possibility to create OR rules
- Add support for Google My Business product feeds
- Build a better WP Cron check, current one is not good enough
- AMAZON integration:
	- requires a professional seller account, 39 dollar a month, before being able to create a developer account
	- only than we can use their MWS service needed to connect our plugin
