Free Live Chat & Helpdesk for WooCommerce. Integrate in 2 mins.

== Description ==

Richpanel is an easy to use Helpdesk & Live Chat Software designed specifically for WooCommerce stores. **A free plan is available.**

Richpanel enables support agents to interact with customers & see WooCommerce data in a single chat UI. It's much better than the current method which requires support agents to toggle between multiple tools to lookup customer info & execute actions.

== Why Richpanel? ==

1. **Stunning live chat & bots**
Setup a beautiful chat messenger & bots for your website in seconds. Bots can automatically qualify visitors & route customers to correct agents.

2. **Manage all support channels from one place**
Customers can contact you on live chat, email, contact forms & Whatsapp. And you can manage all messages from a single view.

3. **Know everything about your customers**
Richpanel pulls in data from your WooCommerce store so agents can view customer's previous orders and website activities. Agents can see and use WooCommerce data in responses and macros. They have all context to assist customer queries quickly, at scale.

4. **Let customers continue the chat even after they leave the website**
A typical visitor will stay on your website for less than 5 minutes. It's not always possible to respond before the visitor leaves the site. With Richpanel, customers can continue the conversation on email if they go offline.

5. **Track Team Performance with beautiful Helpdesk Reports**
See how agents are performing at customer feedback & response times and assisting conversions. Richpanel also measures what agents are influencing sales and creating long term customer relationships. Filter reports by tags, channel (live chat, email, social) & agents.
