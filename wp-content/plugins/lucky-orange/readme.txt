## Do you know why your visitors don't convert?

Lucky Orange will help you answer the question of why 99% of visitors that visit your site never turn into customers. It's one of those tools that will have you wondering how you ever lived without it.

## Visitor Recordings
Watch anonymous recordings of visitors navigating and interacting with your site, just like watching a movie. You will be able to see every mouse movement, click, and scroll which will help you answer the question of what are my visitors really doing on my website? Perhaps their never even seeing your call to action button, or maybe it doesn't even work. Discover a wealth of information in seconds with our visitor recordings.

## Heat Maps
Aggregate thousands of visitors browsing data into gorgeous heat maps which show you how people click, move, and scroll all the pages of your site.

## Polls
Ask your customers quick and non-intrusive poll questions, such as "Is there anything preventing you from purchasing today?" Gain valuable and actionable information directly from your visitors.

## Form Analytics
Discover the key fields on your forms where customers are abandoning the checkout or signup process. Learn what fields are taking too long to finish, which fields are being repeated due to errors, and which fields cause the most abandonment.

## Support & Sales Chat
Talk directly with your customers with our fully featured chat system. You can even watch their screen while you chat with them as well as point to areas directly on their screen for further clarification.
